{"New Profit Inc": "New Profit is a nonprofit social innovation organization and venture philanthropy fund based in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n\n== History ==\nNew Profit was founded in 1998 by social entrepreneur Vanessa Kirsch. After starting and growing two nonprofits\u2014Public Allies and the Women's Information Network\u2014Kirsch took a year to travel the world, interviewing social entrepreneurs and citizens across 22 countries. Through this experience, she came to understand that the nonprofit sector lacks sufficient access to second-stage growth capital, locking social entrepreneurs and their funders into a start-up phase mentality. She determined that in order for social entrepreneurs to have the greatest possible impact, they needed access to financial resources that could allow them to sustain and grow their program models.\nIn 1996, she began laying the groundwork for a venture philanthropy fund that would provide social entrepreneurs and their organizations with funding and valuable strategic consulting services. After over a year of research and development with a team of social entrepreneurs, academics, and philanthropists, Kirsch and a partner founded New Profit in 1998. With support from Monitor Group and under Kirsch's continued leadership, New Profit has worked with 34 nonprofit organizations to date.New Profit was based in Cambridge, MA from its founding in 1998 until a move to Boston in April 2013.\n\n\n== Mission and Model ==\nNew Profit's mission is to help innovative social entrepreneurs and their organizations dramatically improve opportunities for children, families, and communities. New Profit works to fulfill this mission through two related approaches:\n1. Directly supporting a group of social entrepreneur-led nonprofits with multi-year grants and strategic support.\n2. Developing field-wide initiatives through the Action Tank that seek to help all social entrepreneurs and their organizations impact the social problems they seek to solve.\n\n\n== Direct Support to Organizations ==\nNew Profit provides grants to organizations that address issues in education, workforce development, public health, or poverty alleviation through its portfolio. Once a nonprofit organization has received funding, New Profit focuses on support efforts that help integrate financial and strategic resources to help the organization develop and grow into a sustainable program.\nA staff member at New Profit works with each organization that New Profit funds as a portfolio manager. This person takes a board seat and acts as a day-to-day advisor to the organization, building a partnership with the social entrepreneur and creating a plan for future projects that are tailored to the organization's needs. The strategic support each nonprofit receives assumes a variety of forms, from refining the organizations\u2019 social change model and helping find talent, to developing and coaching the board. In addition, New Profit also offers strategic growth planning and executive coaching for the social entrepreneur, and connects each nonprofit with pro-bono consulting services from Monitor Group.\nWith funding awarded in July 2010 through the federal Social Innovation Fund, New Profit developed the Pathways Fund, through which it makes grants to organizations that focus on helping disconnected youth ages 18 to 24. The Pathways Fund will seek to improve high school completion rates, increase college enrollment and persistence, and better prepare youth to enter the workforce in select geographies across the U.S.\n\n\n== Action Tank Initiatives ==\nIn 2004, as it began to see program results from its first group of supported nonprofits, New Profit created the Action Tank in an effort to work beyond the organizations it directly funds. The Action Tank has initiatives in three focus areas:\n\nFederal Policy:  Through an initiative called America Forward, a nonpartisan coalition of nearly 50 nonprofit organizations, New Profit seeks to advance a policy agenda and create an infrastructure for social entrepreneurs and government to act together to grow of effective nonprofit organizations.\nEvents:  Through its annual event, the Gathering of Leaders, New Profit brings together leaders from the public, private, philanthropic, and nonprofit sectors to develop new ideas, relationships, and resources and help build stronger nonprofit organizations.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nNew Profit tracks the progress of organizations it funds against five major focus areas\u2014impact and innovation, growth, leadership and governance, organizational strategy, and metrics. To measure this progress, New Profit has developed a Growth Diagnostic Tool that it uses to assess the development of each nonprofit it funds and to then focus additional support where it is most necessary.Within the portfolio of nonprofit organizations it supports, New Profit targets a 30 percent compound annual growth rate for revenue and a 40 percent compound annual growth rate for clients served. In 2009, New Profit reported that its portfolio of supported organizations achieved a 35 percent compound annual growth rate for revenue and a 40 percent compound annual growth rate for clients served.\n\n\n== Current Investments ==\nAchievement First\nBUILD\nCollege Possible\nCollege Summit\nEye to Eye\nFamily Independence Initiative\nFirst Place for Youth\nHealth Leads\niMentor\nKnowledge Is Power Program (KIPP)\nLIFT\nManagement Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT)\nNational College Advising Corps\nNew Leaders\nNew Teacher Center\nPeace First\nPeer Health Exchange\nSingle Stop USA\nTeach For All\nThe Mission Continues\nTurnaround for Children\nYear Up\nYouthBuild USA\n\n\n== Past Investments ==\nBuilding Educated Leaders for Life (BELL)\nCitizen Schools\nComputers for Youth\nFreelancers Union\nGirls for a Change\nJumpstart for Young Children\nKids Voting USA\nRare Conservation\nRight To Play\nStand for Children\nTeach For America\nUpwardly Global\n\n\n== References ==", "Banja Luka Stock Exchange": "The Banja Luka Stock Exchange or BLSE (Serbian: \u0411\u0430\u045a\u0430\u043b\u0443\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0437\u0430, romanized: Banjalu\u010dka berza) is a stock exchange which operates in the city of Banja Luka in the Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

It is the fourth largest university in North Carolina.\nFounded on March 8, 1907, as a teacher training school, East Carolina has grown from 43 acres (17 ha) to almost 1,600 acres (647 ha) today. The university's academic facilities are located on six properties: Main Campus, Health Sciences Campus, West Research Campus, the Field Station for Coastal Studies in New Holland, North Carolina, the Millennial Research Innovation Campus in Greenville's warehouse district and an overseas campus in Certaldo Alto, Italy. ECU also operates the Coastal Studies Institute. The nine undergraduate colleges, graduate school, and four professional schools are located on these four properties. All of the non-health sciences majors are located on the main campus. The College of Nursing, College of Allied Health Sciences, The Brody School of Medicine, and School of Dental Medicine are located on the health science campus. There are eleven social sororities, 16 social fraternities, four historically black sororities, five historically black fraternities, one Native American fraternity, and one Native American sorority. There are over 400 registered clubs on campus including fraternities and sororities.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPublic Laws of North Carolina, 1907, Chapter 820 titled An Act to Stimulate High School Instruction in the Public Schools of the State and Teacher Training is the official law chartering East Carolina Teachers Training School (ECTTS) on March 8, 1907 by the North Carolina General Assembly. The chairman of its original Board of Trustees, Thomas Jordan Jarvis, a former Governor of North Carolina now known as the \"Father of ECU\", participated in groundbreaking ceremonies for the first buildings on July 2, 1908 in Greenville, North Carolina and ECTTS opened its doors on October 5, 1909. Although its purpose was to train \"young white men and women\", there were no male graduates until 1932. In 1920, ECTTS became a four\u2013year institution and renamed East Carolina Teachers College; its first bachelor's degrees were awarded the following year in education. A master's degree program was authorized in 1929; the first such degree granted by the college was in 1933. Progress toward full college status was made in 1948 with the designation of the bachelor of arts as a liberal arts degree, and the bachelor of science as a teaching degree. A change of name to East Carolina College in 1951 reflected this expanded mission. Over the objections of Governor Dan K. Moore, who opposed the creation of a university system separate from the Consolidated University of North Carolina, ECC was made a regional university effective July 1, 1967, and assumed its present name, East Carolina University. The university did not remain independent for long; on July 1, 1972, it was incorporated into the University of North Carolina System, the successor to the Consolidated University. Today, ECU is the fourth\u2013largest university in North Carolina with 21,589 undergraduate and 5,797 graduate students, including the 308 medicine and 52 dental students.\n\n\n== Campus ==\n\nEast Carolina is separated into three distinct campuses: Main Campus, Health Sciences Campus, and West Research Campus. It owns two sports complexes: Blount Recreational Sports Complex and North Recreational Complex. It owns a field station in New Holland, North Carolina.\n\n\n=== Main ===\nThe main campus, also known as the east campus, is about 530 acres (2 km2) in an urban residential area of downtown Greenville. The 158 buildings on main campus comprise more than 4.6 million square feet (325,000 m2) of academic, research, and residential space. Many of the Main Campus buildings feature the Spanish\u2013Mission style architecture; inspiration drawn from Thomas Jarvis' time as an ambassador to Brazil. He wanted to bring the unique architecture to eastern North Carolina. On the main campus, there are five districts: Campus Core, Downtown District, Warehouse District, Athletic fields and the South Academic District. On the Campus Core, there are 15 residence halls which are divided into three separate neighborhoods. The distinct feature of the main campus is the mall, which is a large tree\u2013laden grassy area where many students go to relax. In the middle of the mall is the replica of the cupola on the original Austin building.\n\n\n==== Athletic fields ====\nThe varsity athletics fields are located south of the College Hill residential neighborhood. Fourteenth Street divides College Hill to the north, with the athletic fields to the south. Charles Boulevard borders the fields to the west and Greenville Boulevard borders it to the south.

On the southern border of the practice facility is Clark-LeClair Stadium, which is the men's baseball stadium. It opened in 2005 and seats 3,000 in permanent seating with another 2,000 located in the outfield. At the southern end of the fields is the Olympic Sports Complex, which include women's soccer stadium, softball stadium, track and field facility, and Olympic Sports Team building. The Olympic Sports Complex was completed in 2011 with a price of $23.4 million. The Smith-Williams Center is a $17 million basketball development and practice facility, opened in 2013. The football stadium is planning for a $40 million upgrade. The upgrades will include a new press, club, and suite areas, and upper deck, all located on the south side. This addition will increase the capacity from 50,000 to 60,000.East Carolina has spent $92 million on athletic projects from 1998 to 2011. Including the proposed projects, this is increased to $145 million.\n\n\n=== Health Sciences ===\nThe Health Sciences campus prepares health care practitioners across a full range of professions, including nurses, dentists, physical therapists, speech therapists, physicians, and more.

It first appeared in the 1940\u201341 East Carolina Teachers College Student Handbook. It was written by Harold A. McDougle ('44) who became a part-time instructor in the Music Department from 1946 to 1947. The Marching Pirates perform the song during all home football and basketball games. At every home football game, after the National Anthem is played by the band, the Alma Mater is played followed by the E.C. Victory song. At the end of football games, the football team walks to the student section to sing the Alma Mater and E.C. Victory song in unison.\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n\nPirate graduates have been influential in teaching, business, and the arts.

Zurich Airport serves as the hub, Geneva Airport as a focus city. The airline was formed following the bankruptcy in 2002 of Swissair, Switzerland's then flag carrier. The new airline was built around what had been Swissair's regional subsidiary, Crossair. Swiss retains Crossair's IATA code LX (Swissair's code was SR). It assumed Swissair's old ICAO code of SWR (Crossair's was CRX), to maintain international traffic rights. It is a member of Star Alliance and a subsidiary of the Lufthansa Group. Its headquarters are at EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg near Basel, Switzerland, and an office at Zurich Airport in Kloten, Switzerland. The company's registered office is in Basel.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nSwiss was formed after the 2002 bankruptcy of Swissair, Switzerland's former flag carrier. 40% of Crossair's income came from Swissair. The new airline lost US$1.6 billion from 2002 to 2005. Swissair's biggest creditors, Credit Suisse and UBS, sold part of Swissair's assets to Crossair, which had been Swissair's regional counterpart. At the time, both Swissair and Crossair were part of the same holding company, SAirGroup. Crossair later changed its name to Swiss International Air Lines, and the new national airline officially started operations on 31 March 2002. The airline was initially owned by institutional investors (61.3%), the Swiss Confederation (20.3%), cantons and communities (12.2%) and others (6.2%). Swiss also owns subsidiaries Swiss Sun (100%) and Crossair Europe (99.9%). It has a total of 7,383 employees.According to Marcel Biedermann, the managing director of intercontinental markets for Swiss, there were three possibilities: stay independent as a niche carrier, shrink to an unrecognisable level, or attach onto another airline group. The last choice was taken. Swiss talked to Air France\u2013KLM, British Airways, and Lufthansa. However, Swiss was tied up with debt and an uncertain future and seemed to be an unattractive investment. After merging with KLM, Air France said they were too busy to deal with Swiss joining them. British Airways was open, and Oneworld partners thought Zurich Airport would be a viable alternative hub for London Heathrow.\n\nAfter almost a year of disputes, Swiss was finally accepted into the Oneworld airline alliance, after having been blocked by British Airways, which competes with Swiss on many long-haul routes. On 3 June 2004, Swiss announced its decision not to join Oneworld because they did not want to integrate their current frequent flyer program into British Airways' Executive Club. Furthermore, Swiss thought the relationship was one-sided, where British Airways sapped out the benefits of the airline, but they would get no return.\n\n\n=== Recovery ===\nThe airline annually halved its losses, and in 2006 recorded a net profit of $220 million. The net profit for 2007 was $570 million. Biedermann stated in the March 2008 edition of Airways, that \"this was the beginning of getting our house back in order.\" He said that help was needed and looked up to Lufthansa as a comparison, so their coming together was natural, even with their differences. Even with the smaller network, Swiss carries the same number of passengers as they did in 2002.\nOn 22 March 2005, Lufthansa Group confirmed its plan to take over Swiss, starting with a minority stake (11%) of a new company set up to hold Swiss shares called Air Trust. Swiss operations were gradually integrated with Lufthansa's from late 2005, and the takeover was completed on 1 July 2007. Swiss joined Star Alliance and became a member of Lufthansa's Miles and More frequent flyer program on 1 April 2006.The airline set up a regional airline subsidiary called Swiss European Air Lines. The carrier had its own air operator's certificate. Two divisions -\u2013Swiss Aviation Training and Swiss WorldCargo (using the belly capacity of passenger planes) \u2013 are also owned by Swiss. Swiss European Air Lines (later renamed Swiss Global Air Lines) has since ceased operations and merged with its parent, Swiss.\nIn 2008, Swiss International Air Lines acquired Edelweiss Air and Servair \u2013 later renamed Swiss Private Aviation. In February 2011, Swiss Private Aviation ceased operations as a result of restructuring. The company recommended using Lufthansa Private Jet Service instead.In 2007, Swiss ordered nine Airbus A330-300s to gradually replace existing A330-200s and has three-class seating.  The first A330-300 was put into service on the flagship Z\u00fcrich to New York-JFK route in April 2009. In spring 2010 Swiss operated five A330-300s on medium and long-haul routes. The remaining four A330-300 aircraft joined the fleet in 2011.\n\n\n=== Takeover by Lufthansa ===\nFollowing Lufthansa Group's takeover, the regional fleet was changed from Crossair's Embraer ERJs and Saabs to Avro RJs, which were flown by a wholly owned subsidiary, Swiss Global Air Lines. The rest of the fleet was rationalised and now mainly consists of Airbus aircraft, apart from the Boeing 777.\nSwiss also renegotiated their supplier contracts, including ground handling, maintenance, food service, and labour. Swiss shareholders received a performance-based option for their shares. Payment was in 2008, and the amount depended on how well Lufthansa's shares compared with competitors' shares. Lufthansa continues to maintain Swiss as a separate brand.\nIn 2010, Swiss and Lufthansa were named in a European Commission investigation into price-fixing but were not fined due to acting as a whistleblower.On 18 August 2011, Swiss introduced a new company logo which resembled the logo of the defunct Swissair.\n\n\n== Corporate affairs ==\n\n\n=== Head office ===\n\nSwiss International Air Lines has its operational headquarters at EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg near Basel, Switzerland. The French-Swiss airport is located on French territory and has customs-free access to Switzerland. The Swiss head office is located in the Swiss section of the airport, and it is only accessible from Switzerland. According to the commercial register, the legal seat is in Basel itself.Swiss International Air Lines' head office was previously the head office of Crossair. In 2002 the \"Crossair\" sign on the building was replaced by a \"Swiss International Air Lines\" one. As of 2004 the Basel area offices housed about 1,000 employees, while the Zurich area offices housed about 850 employees. When Swiss started as a company, about 1,400-1,500 worked at the Basel offices.SWISS also operates offices at Zurich Airport in Kloten and at Geneva Airport.\n\n\n=== Subsidiaries ===\nThe following companies are part of the Swiss International Air Lines Group:\n\nEdelweiss Air\nSwiss AviationSoftware\nSwiss Aviation Training\nSwiss WorldCargo\nSWISStours\n\n\n=== Inflight service ===\nOn European flights, Swiss serves drinks. Depending on the time of day and the duration of the flight, Swiss may also serve snacks. Cold snacks are served on shorter flights, hot ones on longer flights. Economy class service includes sandwiches from a Swiss bakery. Swiss chocolate is provided to passengers prior to landing on most flights. For its Geneva services on Bombardier CSeries (Airbus A220) aircraft a buy on board system called Swiss Saveurs is available. Business or Economy Flex/Classic passengers get a free beverage and sandwich. [1]\n\n\n=== Trains and buses ===\nSwiss' Airtrain service allows passengers to take any SBB train at no extra charge from Zurich Airport to Basel SBB railway station and Lugano railway station. Swiss previously operated a Swissbus service from Ottawa Railway Station to Dorval Airport in Montreal.\n\n\n== Destinations ==\n\n\n=== Codeshare agreements ===\nSwiss International has codeshare agreements with the following airlines:\n\n\n=== Interline agreements ===\nSwiss International has interline agreements with the following airlines:\n\n\n== Fleet ==\n\n\n=== Current fleet ===\nAs of March 2020, the Swiss International Air Lines fleet consists of the following aircraft:\n\nSwiss carrier Helvetic Airways operates ten Embraer 190 aircraft on behalf of Swiss. Following Helvetic Airways' acquisition of the type, Helvetic Airways will also operate Embraer 190-E2 aircraft on behalf of Swiss. Adria Airways operated two Saab 2000s on the Zurich - Lugano route, which was suspended after Adria's bankruptcy on 30 September 2019.The Boeing 777-300ER and Airbus A220-100/-300 (Bombardier CS100/CS300) aircraft were operated by Swiss Global Air Lines until the subsidiary ceased operations in April 2018, in an attempt to lower administration costs and simplify Swiss' fleet structuring.The aircraft fleet has been named after local towns and cities since 2007. The names are featured on the aircraft fuselage, with cabin interiors showing the coat of arms of the town or city.\n\n\n=== Fleet development ===\nOn 22 September 2010, Lufthansa announced an order for 48 new aircraft, several of them for Swiss.In March 2013, Swiss ordered six Boeing 777-300ERs. On 12 March 2015, Swiss confirmed that the Lufthansa Group had ordered an additional three Boeing 777-300ERs for Swiss. The 777s will be operated by, and leased back from, Swiss Global Air Lines. Swiss has confirmed that all 777-300ERs will have an updated First Class cabin with eight private suites and a 32-inch TV, 62 business class seats which convert into a fully flat bed that is over two meters long, and 270 economy seats, with 10 seats abreast in a 3-4-3 layout, using the same seat pitch and width on its A330s and A340s on the 777s. The first of these new airliners was delivered in January 2016 and is Swiss's first Boeing aircraft. The Boeing aircraft will replace most of Swiss' current A340 aircraft, the remaining five A340s will be refurbished.\nIn 2014, Swiss announced it would refurbish its A320 fleet, with new interiors and the older A320s and A321s will be replaced by A320/A321neos.  The A319s, along with Swiss Global Air Lines' Avro fleet, will be replaced by Bombardier CS300 aircraft in due course. The last remaining Avro RJ100 aircraft, HB-IYZ, completed its last flight, LX7545 from Geneva to Zurich on 15 August 2017.Swiss' first CS300/A220-300 (to replace RJ100s plus older A319/A320s) entered service at Geneva on 1 June 2017 - with its maiden commercial flight as Geneva - London Heathrow. Swiss was the launch customer of the entire Airbus A220 (formerly known as Bombardier CSeries) family of aircraft, with its first CSeries aircraft, a CS100 (A220-100), delivered to the airline in June 2016, registered HB-JBA. The first commercial flight it performed was Zurich - Paris CDG.\n\n\n=== Retired fleet ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Lufthansa Group 3rd Interim report 2013\" (PDF).\nKen Donohue, \"Swiss continues a proud tradition\", Airways Magazine: A Global Review of Commercial Flight, March 2008, 22\u201323, 25, 28.\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Swiss International Air Lines at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website\nSwiss World Cargo\nSwiss Aviation Training", "Interfaith Medical Center": "Interfaith Medical Center is a hospital located in Brooklyn, New York. With facilities in Crown Heights, Bedford-Stuyvesant, and Prospect Heights, it is a full-service non-profit community hospital that has 287 beds and serves more than 11,000 inpatients each year. It also has more than 200,000 outpatient visits and services and 50,000 emergency department visits annually. Interfaith is also a teaching hospital, with four graduate medical education residency programs, and fellowship programs in Pulmonary Medicine, Cardiology and Gastroenterology. Interfaith continues to serve as a safety-net hospital for its surrounding community since it emerged from bankruptcy in 2014.In addition to its main campus at 1545 Atlantic Avenue, Interfaith has other buildings which house specialists who provide care and offer community education and physician referrals to several other areas in Central Brooklyn. The largest is the Bishop Orris G. Walker, Jr. Healthcare Center, located at 528 Prospect Place and serving Prospect Heights and Crown Heights. The Bishop Orris G. Walker Center houses most outpatient specialties along with an internal medicine clinic and Atlantic Urgent Care.\n\n\n== History ==\nInterfaith Medical Center was formed on December 31, 1982 with the merger of two large, previously independent hospitals, the Brooklyn Jewish Hospital and Medical Center in Crown Heights and St. John's Episcopal Hospital in Bedford-Stuyvesant.\n\n\n=== St. John's Episcopal Hospital ===\nThe official date for the dedication and incorporation of the St. John's Episcopal Hospital are unknown. The best documentation dates St. John's Episcopal Hospital's services to the mid-19th century. The Episcopal Diocese of Long Island established the St. John's Episcopal Home for the Aged and the Blind on Herkimer Street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.\n\n\n=== Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn and Medical Center ===\nThe Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn opened as a small dispensary at 70 Johnson Street in 1895. Originally the Jewish Hospital Society of Brooklyn, the dispensary grew to serve the burgeoning populations of Crown Heights and Prospect Heights. On December 9, 1906, the society dedicated the Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn.\nBy the 1950s, it had grown to be one of the largest and best hospital complexes in Brooklyn. In addition to the main building, which faced Classon Avenue, the hospital had a nursing school and residence (built in 1927) and several adjoining pavilions, wings and clinics, the last of which seem to date from the 1950s. In December 1948, Dr. Rudolph Nissen, a hospital surgeon, famous for developing a widely used operation to prevent esophageal reflux, performed an exploratory laparotomy on Albert Einstein at the hospital.\n\n\n=== Merger ===\nSt. John's Episcopal and Brooklyn Jewish Hospital both grew during the first half of the 20th century. At the heights of their successes, they were the largest employers in Central Brooklyn. However, after World War II, the population of the neighborhood began to change. The affluent residents began to decamp to the suburbs and were replaced by a less wealthy population. The patients in the area began to become more reliant on Medicare and Medicaid, and these government programs paid less than private health insurers. As a result, the both hospitals became increasingly financially unstable.\nBrooklyn Jewish Hospital declared bankruptcy in 1979. It received federal protection, was able to reorganize, and its operations continued until 1982.\nAlthough St. John's did not declare bankruptcy, its finances nevertheless became increasingly precarious. To save the two hospitals, a merger was completed in December 1982. The combined entity was called Interfaith Medical Center.\nAfter the merger, Interfaith continued to struggle financially. In 1985, its medical residents went on a two-week strike over disputed wages and long hours of work.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n\n=== Behavioral Health Services ===\nOfferings in behavioral health are a mainstay of Interfaith's medical services. The medical center provides a wide array of outpatient, inpatient and emergency behavioral health, psychiatric, detoxification, and drug rehabilitation programs. The hospital also assists patients in entering housing and outpatient chemical dependency programs.\n\n\n=== Bishop Orris G. Walker Jr. Health Care Center ===\nThis center provides numerous outpatient services. The facility consists of 34 outpatient clinics in general medicine and a wide range of other specialties and subspecialties.\n\n\n=== AIDS Treatment Center ===\nInterfaith provides federally supported care and treatment services in their AIDS Treatment Center.\n\n\n== Hospital rating data ==\nThe HealthGrades website contains the clinical quality data for Interfaith Medical Center, as of 2017. For this rating section three different types of data from HealthGrades are presented: clinical quality ratings for thirteen inpatient conditions and procedures, twelve patient safety indicators and the percentage of patients giving the hospital as a 9 or 10 (the two highest possible ratings).\nFor inpatient conditions and procedures, there are three possible ratings: worse than expected, as expected, better than expected.  For this hospital the data for this category is:\n\nWorse than expected \u2013 7\nAs expected \u2013 5\nBetter than expected \u2013 1For patient safety indicators, there are the same three possible ratings.

In December 2009, the district administration reported that 475 pupils or 11% of the district's pupils received Special Education services.In order to comply with state and federal laws, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs.  At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration.  When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation.  Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Special Education Department.In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.  The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.Waynesboro Area School District received a $2,257,352 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011\u201312, 2012\u201313 and 2013-14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. In 2014-2015, the district will receive $2,282,591 for special education services.\n\n\n=== Gifted education ===\nWaynesboro Area School District Administration reported that 91 or 2.14% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation.  All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility.\n\n\n== Budget ==\nPennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE).

A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Waynesboro Area School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each public school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the district's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are Elementary School - $7,204.27, High School - $7,741.60.Waynesboro Area School District is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax - 1%, a local real property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, and a per capita tax $5, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes.

In 2012, the district reported that it held $2,970,015 in unreserved funds and $5,355,043 in reserve funds. Pennsylvania public school district reserve funds are divided into two categories \u2013 designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings.  According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.

For the 2008-09 school year, the program was offered in 143 schools reaching 66,973 students across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In 2007, the Pennsylvania Department of Education initiated an effort to improve science instruction in the Commonwealth's public elementary schools. Called Science: It's Elementary, the program was a hands on instruction approach for elementary science classes that develops problem-solving and critical thinking skills. To encourage schools to adopt the program's standards aligned curriculum, the state provided a grant to cover the costs of materials and extensive mandatory teacher training. The district was required to develop a three-year implementation plan for the participating school. The Waynesboro Area School District administration was required to appoint a district liaison who was paid $3,000 by PDE to serve as the conduit of all information between the district and the Department and its agents along with submitting orders and distributing supplies to implementing teachers. For the 2006-07 state education budget, $10 million was allocated for the program. The grant program was expanded to $14.5 million in the 2008-09 budget. The grant was discontinued in the state's 2011 budget by Governor Edward G. Rendell.\n\n\n==== Classrooms for the Future grant ====\nThe Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use.

This was in addition to all regular state and federal funding. This funding is for 2009-10 and 2010\u20132011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the Pennsylvania Senate Education Committee, the Governor and the Pennsylvania School Board Association, to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software.\n\n\n==== Race to the Top grant ====\nWaynesboro Area School District officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district millions of additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement.  Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of public school districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.\n\n\n=== Real estate taxes ===\nProperty tax rates in 2014-2015 were set at 86.50 mills by the Waynesboro Area School Board. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts.\n\nAccording to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011. The average yearly property tax paid by Franklin County residents amounts to about 2.94% of their yearly income. Franklin County is ranked 631st of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.\n\n\n==== Act 1 Adjusted index ====\nThe Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise taxes above that index, unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30.  For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. With the 2011 state education budget, the General Assembly voted to end most of the Act 1 exceptions leaving only special education costs and pension costs. The cost of construction projects will go to the voters for approval via ballot referendum.The School District Adjusted Index for the Waynesboro Area School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012.\n\nFor the 2014-15 budget year, Waynesboro Area School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed their Act 1 Index limit.

A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget.

Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption.\nAdditionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650.  Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, so people who make substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.\nIn Pennsylvania, the homestead exclusion reduces the assessed values of homestead properties, reducing the property tax on these homes. The homestead exclusion allows homeowners real property tax relief of up to one half of the median assessed value of homesteads in the taxing jurisdiction (county, school district, city, borough, or township).\n\n\n== Wellness policy ==\nWaynesboro Area School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006 \u2013 Policy 246. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 \u2013 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\"\nThe legislation placed the responsibility of developing a Student Wellness Policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval.\nThe Waynesboro Area School District offers a free school breakfast and free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals. The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D. In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch.  The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that Districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non-subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93.\nIn 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk.Waynesboro Area School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available  to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight.\n\n\n== Extracurriculars ==\nThe Waynesboro Area School District offers a variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, costly sports program. The school board determines eligibility for participation in coordination with respective individual governing organizations. Varsity, junior varsity  and middle school athletic activities are under the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association.\nBy Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.According to Pennsylvania's Safety in Youth Sports Act, all sports coaches, paid and volunteer, are required to annually complete the Concussion Management Certification Training and present the certification before coaching.Coaches receive compensation as outlined in the teachers' union contract. When athletic competition exceeds the regular season, additional compensation is paid.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe district funds:\n\nMiddle School Sports\n\nAccording to PIAA directory July 2013 \n\n\n== References ==", "Tamworth High School": "Tamworth High School is a government-funded co-educational comprehensive secondary day school, located in Willis Street, South Tamworth, a suburb of the Tamworth Regional Council local government area in the New England region of New South Wales, Australia. \nEstablished in 1919, the school enrolled approximately 670 students in 2018, from Year 7 to Year 12, of whom 31 percent identified as Indigenous Australians and four percent were from a language background other than English.

This building is grade II* listed and retains many original features. It was built in 1752 as a town house for George Smith, grandson of the founder of Smith's Bank, the oldest known provincial bank in the United Kingdom. In 1929 Evans, Clark and Woollatt added a new doorway and frontage, allowing the ground floor to be converted for retail use.In the first-floor 'Standfast Library' is a Meridian Line, dating from 1836 and used to set clocks to Noon 'local' time in the days before Railway time or Greenwich Mean Time was introduced as the British standard.  The longcase clock in the room is still set to Nottingham time, 4 minutes and 33 seconds slower than Greenwich.\nIn the attics, Alfred Barber opened the first photographic studio in the Midlands on 2 October 1841.Started 1 April 2019 a major refurbishment project comprising new roof, sympathetically restored attic rooms and essential internal repairs partially funded by a generous grant from Historic England East Midlands. The work is expected to be completed by the end of 2019.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Nottingham Subscription Library was founded on 1 April 1816 at Carlton Street. In April 1820, Bromley House was offered for sale by auction and purchased by the library for \u00a32,750 (equivalent to \u00a3221,438 in 2019). The library moved in in 1821.In the 19th century the library had around one hundred subscribers, including George Green and Edward Bromhead. Historically, the first name on the list of subscribers was the Duke of Newcastle as Lord Lieutenant of the county.\n\n\n== Library services ==\n \nAs of April 2018 had 1,638 members who paid an annual subscription. Items on loan are still recorded using a manual ledger system where each member has their own page. The library has a stock of just under 50,000 books (expanding by 700-800 each year) which includes a good selection of interest to local historians, and a wide selection of 19th and 20th century novels. It also holds audiobooks and CDs.   The Heritage Lottery Fund contributed towards a project to create the library's computer catalogue 'Bromcat'. This involved a team of staff and volunteers cataloguing the entire contents over a two-year period, completing the work in 2013.\n\n\n== Librarians ==\nWilliam Hardy 1816 \u2013 1819\nValentine Kirk 1819 \u2013 1820\nJames Archer 1820 \u2013 1834\nJohn Walton 1834 \u2013 1857\nCount Ubaldo Marioni 1857 \u2013 1865\nJohn Cummings Banwell 1867 \u2013 1893\nJ William Moore 1893 \u2013 1899\nArthur Lineker 1899 \u2013 1926\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCorbett, Jane Y.

The district was featured in the December 2006 issue of THE Journal (a publication dedicated to technology issues in schools) [4] and its long-range plan has the district converting to a completely wireless network, among other options [5].\nPrairiland ISD has been very active in the Texas Rural Education Association (an association of rural school districts in Texas), as two of its superintendents have served as President of TREA (Dr. L. C. Stout as its first president as well as James Morton who retired in November 2009.) [6].  Of the 11 presidents (past and present) of TREA, Prairiland ISD is the only district to furnish more than one.\nPrairiland ISD recently completed renovation of its football stadium, featuring an astroturf playing surface [7].  Although astroturf fields at the high school level are not uncommon in Texas, where high school football is extremely popular, such a field is unusual for a school the size of Prairiland (which is classified by UIL as AA, the second smallest classification).  In addition, the school gymnasium features an overhead scoreboard, an uncommon feature at high school level facilities and very rare at a small school like Prairiland [8].\nPrairiland Junior High was recognized by the Texas Business and Education Coalition on its 2007 Honor Roll of outstanding schools, the second consecutive year a Prairiland ISD school was so honored (Deport Elementary made the 2006 TBEC Honor Roll).  The feat was even more amazing in that the Junior High was only in its third year of existence (previously, grades 6-8 were housed at the Blossom and Deport campuses) [9].\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPrairiland ISD"}
